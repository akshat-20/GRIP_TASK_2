# GRIP_TASK_2
## Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

### About this Notebook
In this notebook, we learn how to use decision tree algorithm and visualize it. We used a iris dataset that is related to iris flowers. Then, we split our data into training and test sets, create a decision tree using training set, evaluate it using test set, and finally visualize it using graphviz and calculate accuracy score.
